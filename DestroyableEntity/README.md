<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-mmorpg/open-mmorpg-addons/refs/heads/master/DestroyableEntity/dist/screenshot.png" width=600 />

Adds HarvestableEntity type that awards items on death (as opposed to per hit). Useful for things like smashing barrels which any proper RPG should have.

- adds optional configuration to always use items in the first weapon. No need to duplicate across weapons or skills.

## Usage

1. edit BarrelHarvestable for drops inside barrel when destroyed
2. assign BarrelHarvestable to BarrelDestroyableEntity
3. (optional) check *Use Items From First Weapon* if you want all weapon types to have equal damage effectiveness and drops. Note that the weapon type will need a Harvest Damage amount. The only weapon types in the default demo with Harvest Damage amount assigned are the Axe and StonePick.
4. assign BarrelDestroyableEntity to a HarvestableSpawnArea
5. add BarrelHarvestable to GameDatabase
